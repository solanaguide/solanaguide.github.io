Solana is a blockchain designed for decentralized apps (Dapps). This open-source project promises faster operation and cheap transaction fees compared to the Ethereum network. By using proof of work, Solana is an eco-friendly network and has less environmental impact than blockchains like Bitcoin.

Recently launched in April 2020, Solana has grown by leaps and bounds. At the time of this article, Solana has jumped from $1.50 in January 2021 to $145.92. It is currently ranked 7th in the world, competing with some of the most popular cryptocurrencies.

## Best Solana NFT Projects

Investing in and collecting NFTs has quickly become increasingly popular. From Beeple’s $69 million NFT sales to $7 million Cryptopunk sales, everyone is trying to get into NFT markets.

While the Ethereum network is still the king of NFTs, Solana is a new rival that offers faster and cheaper transactions. Here are some of the Best NFT projects available on the Solana network.

### [Degenerate Ape Academy](https://www.degenape.academy/)

Created from 137 unique traits, 10,000 Degenerate Apes were minted on August 13th, 2021, for a price of 6 SOL ($873).

Each NFT ape is minted with a variety of traits, from common to mythic. These traits are randomly applied to each ape, giving each a unique appearance and rarity.

The 3-D digital artwork sets Degenerate Ape Academy apart from some of the more popular NFT projects that use randomized appearances and low-quality, pixel artwork.

If you missed out on the presale, you can find plenty of different Degen Apes in a variety of rarities for sale on the secondary market. Many Degen Apes are currently selling for over 110,000 SOL.

Upcoming features for Degen Apes include charity initiates, origin stories for the apes, Ape-Kart, and fractional ownership of Apes. There has not been any word on generation 2 of Degenerate Ape Academy.

### [Solana Monkey Business](https://solanamonkey.business/)

Do you prefer pixel-art generated NFTs like Cryptopunks? Solana Monkey Business is a collection of 5000 unique and randomly generated collectibles stored on the Solana blockchain.

Solana Monkeys are generated from 99 different traits. The traits fill nine layers to create a unique NFT collectible. Many of the traits are extremely rare, and Monkeys with these traits will be extremely valuable on the secondary market.

The minting cost of 2 SOL makes Solana Monkey Business an affordable yet desirable NFT for collectors and investors. Two generations of Solana Monkey Business have already been released, with many more generations planned for the future.

### [SolPunks](https://solpunks.com/)

If you are interested in jumping on the pixel art bandwagon but missed out on Cryptopunk, SolPunks has you covered. SolPunks let you show you are part of the Solana NFT ecosystem and community.

SolPunks are a series of 10,000 pixelated, randomly generated artwork collectibles. The original drop quickly sold out, and after-market prices have been sky-high ever since. Each SolPunk was minted for 3 SOL ($295). Current prices for secondary market SolPunks vary from 9 SOL to 200,000 SOL.

Each SolPunk was minted randomly during the initial drop, meaning every buyer had no idea what their SolPunk would look like. This gave every collector an equal chance to purchase SolPunks with extremely rare or unique characteristics.

### [Bold Badgers](https://boldbadgers.com/)

Bold Badgers is another unique NFT project based on the Solana Blockchain. All attributes for the Bold Badgers were drawn by hand. Plus, the NFT is randomly generated from 170 of these traits. The stylized artwork gives Bold Badgers a unique advantage over other pixelated artwork collections.

10,000 Badgers were randomly generated from the 170 hand-drawn attributes and minted for 5 SOL ($738). Just like other NFT projects, some attributes are scarce and instantly make your NFT a highly sought-after collectible and investment.

After the initial minting was completed and sold out, Bold Badgers have seen considerable increases in value on the secondary markets. Currently, on Solanart, some of the rarest Bold Badgers are reaching prices up to 100,000 SOL ($1.4 million).

The developers are dedicated to building a community for owners of Bold Badgers and hope to make Bold Badgers a lifestyle community with prizes, competitions, and more in the future.

### [Sollamas](https://sollamas.com/)

If you’re bored of punk, monkey, or ape-related NFTs, you should check out Sollamas. Owning a Sollama lets you join the herd.
