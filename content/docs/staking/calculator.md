## How to calculate how much you'll earn staking SOL

1. **Enter The Amount Your Wish To Stake** -
This could be all of your holdings, or just as many SOL as you wish to delegate to the validation network

1. **Optionally Set The APY** -
The Solana annual yield or APY can vary as the network performance improves, but is currently around 8%. You can adjust it if you like.

1. **Optionally, model an increase in the price of SOL** -
Think SOL will go up in price this month or over the next year? If so, you can adjust the percentage you expect SOL to rise and it will update your USD value calculation for you automatically.

Note all 3 time period currently use the same percentage increase for the entire period.
