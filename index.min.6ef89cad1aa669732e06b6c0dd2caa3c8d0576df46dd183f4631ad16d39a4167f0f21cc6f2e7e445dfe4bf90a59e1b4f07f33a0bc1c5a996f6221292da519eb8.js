It\u0026rsquo;s a natural choice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default we assume that the wisdom of crowds has chosen for us: this place is popular, it must be the best. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the way people want to eat at a busy restaurant rather than a deserted one (\u003cem\u003ewho knows what their kitchen looks like?!)\u003c/em\u003e or simply seeking security for their hard earned coins, choosing the well travelled path is a natural, human reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling is compounded by the fact that most lists of validators \u003cem\u003esort by stake\u003c/em\u003e, so the biggest in terms of scale almost always appear at the top of validator lists - including in some of the most popular Solana wallets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while natural, these feelings are deceptive for two reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour coins are safe, wherever they are staked:\u003c/strong\u003e\nSolana\u0026rsquo;s staking  system has been designed with safety in mind. Your staked funds are protected at all times, regardless of which validator you pick to generate your rewards. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if a validator has 10 million coins in delegated stake or just 100 - your assets are equally safe with either\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolana\u0026rsquo;s network relies on decentralization for Proof Of Stake to work\u003c/strong\u003e\nThe way Solana processes and approves transactions relies on stakes being spread across a wide range of validators. The more diverse and decentralized stakes are, the better for the health of the network overall.\nThere is a risk inherent in everyone choosing the most popular validator to stake their coins with: if the majority of coins end up staked with a small number of validators it can lead to a network halt, where inbuilt protections on the integrity of transactions stop working.\nInstead, for the sake of the network, it makes sense to spread stakes out across a far greater number of validators to prevent the likelyhood of a halt or intentional attack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to invest in Solana staking it is in your best interests to support the network by avoiding further concentration of stake among the biggest validators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo our recommendation is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t choose the biggest operators for the sake of their size alone.\u003c/strong\u003e If anything, you should actively avoid them, and either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupport some of the smaller operators to grow their stake and further decentralize the network\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOr spread your stake out across multiple small operators to decentralize even more\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="2-the-amount-of-commission-the-validator-charges"\u003e2. The amount of commission the validator charges\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery validator earns rewards from Solana based on the size of stake they hold. These rewards are then passed to the stake owners, minus a fee that is set by the validator itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFees typically range from 0% (typically for \u0026lsquo;startup\u0026rsquo; validators aiming to attract new stakes) to 10+% for larger validators, or those with big brand names (we\u0026rsquo;re looking at you, exchanges and certain wallets!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking out the commission is straightforward: every validator\u0026rsquo;s commission is exposed publically, and it is simply deducted as a proportion of your rewards (not your stake!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor example:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stake 100 sol at a validator with 10% commission for one year.

But commission is important to ensure a validator can afford to keep validating, giving them an incentive to keep their clusters performing well and generating rewards for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as we\u0026rsquo;ll see next, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not always the biggest impact on your overall return:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick tip:\u003c/strong\u003e When choosing a validator ensure you know which metrics you are looking at.\nFor example. in Phantom Wallet (one of Solana\u0026rsquo;s most popular) not only are validators listed by the biggest stake first (boo!) but they also show the commission rate next to each validator.. unlabelled.\nTo many first timers this can look like the APY reward you will see, not the actual commission paid! In reality the \u003cem\u003elower\u003c/em\u003e the number is in Phantom Wallet, the better for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="3-the-overall-performance-of-the-validator-pool"\u003e3.

So your APY can be affected far more dramatically by slow or broken validators than by their commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, rewards are also based on \u003cem\u003ethe amount of work done by a validator\u003c/em\u003e. This is not quite proof of work in the sense of Bitcoin, GPU farms and environmental destruction. But the fact is a validator earns rewards for every vote it participates in. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up - or is late - then no rewards are paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolana has been built for speed, and so if the hardware a validator is using is too slow to keep up, it will simply be ignored or \u0026lsquo;skipped\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can be seen by the \u0026lsquo;Skipped Vote %\u0026rsquo; shown on \u003ca href="http://validators.app"\u003eValidators.app\u003c/a\u003e . The less votes skipped, the higher the rewards earned each epoch.

Presently there are 132 validators losing money on the network out of 1,002 total validators\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course this calculation doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for the staked amount the validator actually owns, as they will receive 100% of the rewards. So while 50,000 SOL is the breakeven point for a validator charging 10% commission, a validator needs to own \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; 5000 SOL staked to its own network to break even. At current rates that is still around $1m worth of SOL, which few of us have sat around waiting to invest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flip side, the validators at the top of the list are earning handsomely. The top validation network by size of stake is Chrous One, which currently has roughly 15 million SOL staked to its validator and charges a fee of 8%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that number we can estimate they make a profit of $18 million per year, although this is likely ignoring the costs of their hosting infrastructure, dev ops staff and other costs that come with scale, as well as over simplifying: SOL may be worth $180 today, but for most of the year the price of the coin - and the amount staked on the network - has been considerably lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n'}).add({id:3,href:"https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/solana-coin-mining-guide-profitability-rewards-hardware/",title:"Solana Coin Mining Guide: Profitability, Rewards \u0026 Hardware",description:"Want to mine Solana?
