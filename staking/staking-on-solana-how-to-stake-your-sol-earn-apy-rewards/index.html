As it is such a vital function to the network, in exchange rewards are given based on the size of the stake to each participant.</p><p>Currently those rewards equate to a roughly 8% APY annual income on staked coins, of which each validator may take a small fee (typically 0-10%). This means that by simply staking your coins instead of holding them in a wallet you could earn anywhere from 7.2% - 8% each year, which is far in advance of cash interest rates at most banks.</p><hr><div class="alert alert-warning" icon=💡><div class="p-3 text-center"><h3 id=recommended-validator-a-hrefhttpslainecozasolanautm_sourcesolanaguide-target_blank-onclickplausiblevalidator-linklainea>Recommended Validator: <a href="https://laine.co.za/solana?utm_source=solanaguide" target=_blank onclick="plausible('Validator Link')">Laine</a><a href=#recommended-validator-a-hrefhttpslainecozasolanautm_sourcesolanaguide-target_blank-onclickplausiblevalidator-linklainea class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Vote account:</p><div onclick="plausible('Vote Account')"><pre><code class=language-bash>GE6atKoWiQ2pt3zL7N13pjNHjdLVys8LinG8qeJLcAiL

We like Laine, because:</p><ul><li><p>They charge 0% commission - more APY!</p></li><li><p>One of the highest returns of all Solana validators</p></li><li><p>Proactive and resourceful operator in Solana&rsquo;s discord</p></div></li></ul></div><hr><h2 id=how-does-solana-staking-work>How does solana staking work?<a href=#how-does-solana-staking-work class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Solana staking works by &lsquo;delegating&rsquo; your coins to a validator. In this situation your stake acts as a kind of vote of confidence in that validator, a mark of trust that helps the validator confirm transations on the Solana network. At no point does the validator have any access to your coins themselves, they remain securely in your control and can be unstaked at any time (albeit with a slight delay).</p><p>While the validation system of Solana itself is fairly complex, the process of staking your coins is suprisingly simple, in some cases taking just 3 clicks:</p><ol><li>Hold you coins in a wallet that supports staking, such as <a href=https://phantom.app>Phantom</a></li><li>Within you wallet, decide how much to stake. It&rsquo;s wise to keep a small amount of SOL in your wallet at all times to cover transaction fees</li><li>Choose a validator to delegate to - see how to choose the best validator here</li><li>Confirm your stake and start earning rewards!</li></ol><hr><h2 id=how-much-can-you-makeearn-in-rewards-when-staking-solana>How much can you make/earn in rewards when staking Solana?<a href=#how-much-can-you-makeearn-in-rewards-when-staking-solana class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Staking solana will generate rewards for you based on the size of your investment - currently around 8% per year. This means if you stake 100 SOL today, by this time next year you should be the proud owner of 108 SOL.</p><p>But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. We are in a transformative period with cryptocurrency, and Solana is rapidly gaining credibility due to its incredibly fast transactions with very low fees. As a proof of stake network it comes without the baggage of traditional proof of work currencies such as Bitcoin and (for now) Ethereum, and is thriving with the current trend of NFTs as collectors see the huge difference in transaction feed between buying with SOL vs ETH&rsquo;s outrageous gas fees.</p><p>All this is to say there is a strong chance that Solana becomes more popular over time. Past performance is never an indicator of future results, but Solana has increased in price 65x since the start of the year.</p><p>There is no guarantee that it will continue to rise at such a rate, but such increases are not unheard of in the crypto market.</p><p>If you are bullish on crypto, and bullish on SOL&rsquo;s proposition, then you could imagine a much greater increase in value over a year than 8%, when compared to a fiat currency such as USD</p><hr><h3 id=how-long-until-i-earn-rewards-from-my-stake>How long until I earn rewards from my stake?<a href=#how-long-until-i-earn-rewards-from-my-stake class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><h3 id=how-frequent-are-payouts>How frequent are payouts?<a href=#how-frequent-are-payouts class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>Bear in mind that your rewards won&rsquo;t start immediately. Solana&rsquo;s validation network operates in a system of &lsquo;epochs&rsquo; - periods of typically 2-3 days - and rewards are earnt at the end of each epoch.</p><p>When you stake solana to a validator you must wait until the start of the next epoch to being earning rewards.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><p>As I write we are near the end of epoch 220, with a few hours left until epoch 221 starts. If I was to stake 100 SOL now I would start earning rewards in a few hours time.
However if I waited until the evening I would have missed the start of epopch 221, and my delegated stake would earn no rewards until epoch 221 ends and 222 begins, which would take roughly 2-3 days</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering too that <strong>annual rewards</strong> are around 8%. This means rewards per epoch are somewhat lower. Given there are around 134 epochs in a year, the reward you pay per epoch is roughly 0.06%, so you will need to give your investment time to accumulate significant rewards.</p><p>As with all kinds of investing it pays to &lsquo;invest early, invest often&rsquo; to appreciate the benefits of compounding.</p><hr><h2 id=is-solana-staking-safe-what-are-the-risks-if-any>Is solana staking safe? What are the risks, if any?<a href=#is-solana-staking-safe-what-are-the-risks-if-any class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Yes, staking solana is extremely safe: at no point do the validators you stake with have any control over the coins you stake, and you remain in control of your coins throughout the process.</p><p>At any time you can request a withdrawal back to your main wallet - although you will need to wait until the end of the epoch before your coins will arrive, which can take anything from a couple of hours to a couple of days.</p><p>The one risk that does exist is that the commission a validator charges on your rewards is subject to change depending on the whims of the owner.</p><p>This means that you may have signed up to a validator at a fee you thought was fair - say 8% - but the validator could increase this without warning. This might be a minor rise to something like 10%, which would slighly dent your income, or if they truly went rogue they might increase it to 100% and keep all the rewards for themselves.</p><p>However this would not affect the coins you have staked, just the rewards. Since your coins are simply &lsquo;delegated&rsquo; to the validator and not under the validator&rsquo;s control, should this happen your stake would still be 100% safe - you&rsquo;d just stop earning rewards. You could simply leave and move your stake to another more reputable validator.</p><p>This helps keep the market in check - validators rely on having a significant stake delegated to them in order to stay profitable, and any abusive practices would quickly lose their stake. It would be a classic case of killing the golden goose - a short term profit in exchange for a long term business failure.</p><p>Finally of course we should point out that the price of any cryptocurrency, including Solana, can go down as well as up. But if you&rsquo;re here we expect you already understand that.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> On a site such as <a href=http://validators.app>validators.app</a> or <a href=http://solanabeach.io>solanabeach.io</a> you do see validators with commissions set to 100%.
Generally this is not a sign of foul play! It&rsquo;s not uncommon for large financial institutions to run their own private validators, setting the commission to a maximum of 100% to avoid 3rd parties delgating stake to the network. This is mostly done for regulatory reasons - they may have to account for the rewards paid to stakers which for a large financial institution could be a significant legal and administrative burden, so it is simpler to discourage others from staking with them and avoid the issue entirely</p><hr><h2 id=is-solana-staking-worth-it>Is Solana staking worth it?<a href=#is-solana-staking-worth-it class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><h3 id=i-already-own-solana-should-i-be-staking-it>I already own Solana, should I be staking it?<a href=#i-already-own-solana-should-i-be-staking-it class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p><strong>For anyone holding Solana in a wallet</strong> and with no plans to spend it in the next couple of days we would say staking is 100% worth it! There is no sense in keeping your coins sat in wallet while you &lsquo;HODL&rsquo; when you could be earning an income from them.</p><p>That said, if you think you may plan to trade your SOL, buy an NFT or make other use of the coins then you should be aware it could take a couple of days to &lsquo;unstake&rsquo; your coins, so this should play into your strategy.</p><p>You may wish to keep a proportion of your sol in a wallet as &lsquo;spending money&rsquo; and the rest of your SOL staked, much as you might keep a current accoutn and savings account for your household.</p><h3 id=i-dont-own-solana-but-im-interested-in-staking>I don&rsquo;t own Solana but I&rsquo;m interested in staking<a href=#i-dont-own-solana-but-im-interested-in-staking class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p><strong>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t yet hold SOL</strong> the question is a little more complicated. If you&rsquo;re looking to hold some crypto and hope to see a return that beats the market, it is definitely worth considering. SOL&rsquo;s staking rewards are roughly equivalent to the <strong>average annual return</strong> you might see from buying an stock market index tracking ETF or fund, and any growth in value of the coin over the period you stake for could take your staking rewards far beyond that of the equities markets.</p><p>However you also need to consider questions such as:</p><ul><li>Do I think Solana has a bright future?</li><li>Do I think I&rsquo;ll see Solana grow in value more or less than competing coins over the next year?</li><li>Do I feel the crypto markets in general will trend up?</li><li>Are there any other coins I could stake my money to with better rewards?</li></ul><p>For example there are coins out there that offer higher percentages for your stake - some as high as 15%!</p><p>But your decision on where to stake should be more than just the raw figure for APY return. If you earn 15% on a coin that drops in value by 30% you&rsquo;ve made a net loss, so you should really stake your funds with a coin you believe in and trust.</p><hr><h2 id=why-does-solana-pay-rewards-to-crypto-stakers-what-are-the-benefits-for-them>Why does Solana pay rewards to crypto stakers? What are the benefits for them?<a href=#why-does-solana-pay-rewards-to-crypto-stakers-what-are-the-benefits-for-them class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Solana&rsquo;s goal is to offer a decentralized currency that is scalable, cost efficient and extremely fast. To do so it has based its coin on a Proof Of Stake system where validators help ensure the integrity of the system, approving transactions in a fraction of the time of other coins such as ETH or BTC.</p><p>In order to do so it needs to incentivise the validators to help assist in auditing transactions. Since each validator also needs to hold a stake as a sign it can be trusted, these rewards are shared with people who choose to stake their SOL in the validation network.</p><p>By spreading stakes across the thousand+ validators in the network rather than concentrating it in the hands of a small minority it keeps the network robust and secure, preventing attacks from bad actors that might attempt to defraud holders of SOL.</p><p>In short: not only do you earn monetary rewards by staking your coins on Solana, but you actively help Solana reach its goals and ensure the integrity of the network. For many this is reason enough to stake coins or run validators, beyond any personal gain.</p><hr><h2 id=what-apy-can-you-earn-staking-solana>What APY can you earn staking solana?<a href=#what-apy-can-you-earn-staking-solana class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The APY for Solana can fluctuate depending on the number of transactions per day and the speed at which validators complete an epoch, but at present it is between 7-8%.</p><p>The actual amount of reward you receive each epoch can also vary based on the commission rate set by the validator you stake with. These are displayed transparently by the network, and typically range between 0 and 10%. It is worth noting that the operators of validators can change this rate.</p><p>Your real world returns can also depend on the performance of a validator - how fast are they processing and voting on transactions? This can be dependent on uptime, internet connectivity speeds and the power of the servers the validator is using.</p><p>Helpfully there is a site that shows the true, live APR you can earn from each validator, <a href=http://stakeview.app>Stakeview.app</a> . The site automatically computes:</p><ul><li>The performance of the individual validator in the last epoch, including<ul><li>Uptime / Reliability</li><li>Speed (indicated by a lower &lsquo;skip rate&rsquo;)</li></ul></li><li>Minus the commission they charge</li><li>Averaged over the year</li></ul><p>This then provides a figure for the &lsquo;true&rsquo; APY of a validator, which currently ranges from 8.25% to as low as 1%. Crucially some of the validators with low APY actually have fairly low commissions - between 5-10% - so their poor performance is due to technical issues rather than commission rate alone.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-minimum-amount-you-can-stake-on-solana>Is there a minimum amount you can stake on Solana?<a href=#is-there-a-minimum-amount-you-can-stake-on-solana class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>There is no minimum amount you can stake on Solana. Each Solana coin (SOL) can be spent in tiny increments known as Lamports. Much like there are 100 cents in 1 Dollar, there are 10 billion (10,000,000,00) lamports in 1 SOL. Or put another way, 1 lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.</p><p>Theoretically you could stake just a handful of lamports, although not only would you be waiting forever for rewards of any useful size, but you would also likely spend more on transaction fees than you would ever stand to make.</p><p>As with any sort of investment with a percentage return, the more you stake the greater your return. With the power of compound interest you can see considerable returns over time, but much like saving for retirement it really pays to stake more, earlier.</p><h2 id=the-impact-of-commission-on-your-solana-stake-rewards>The impact of commission on your Solana stake rewards<a href=#the-impact-of-commission-on-your-solana-stake-rewards class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Every validator on the Solana network can choose to charge a commission on your rewards. This is their payment for the computing time they spend validating, as well as a rebate on the fees they pay to vote and participate in the Solana system.</p><p>As an example, if we assume the global APY is 8%, you would receive:</p><ul><li>6.8% APY at 15% commission</li><li>7.04% APY at 12% commission</li><li>7.2% APY at 10% commission</li><li>7.28% APY at 9% commission</li><li>7.36% APY at 8% commission</li><li>7.44% APY at 7% commission</li><li>7.52% APY at 6% commission</li><li>7.6% APY at 5% commission</li><li>7.68% APY at 4% commission</li><li>7.76% APY at 3% commission</li><li>7.84% APY at 2% commission</li><li>7.92% APY at 1% commission</li><li>8% APY at 0% commission</li></ul><p>In general, a lower commission is better, but as we can see from <a href=http://stakeview.app>stakeview.app</a> it is also important to consider overall performance - if a validator goes down for half an epoch the rewards will be slashed in half. Additionally if a validator has performance issues and cannot keep up with the network it will &lsquo;skip&rsquo; blocks.</p><p>A higher skip rate means a lower share of rewards for that epoch, which means lower returns for all those who have delegated their stake to that validator. Well run validators will see higher returns than slower or unreliable validators - and poor performance can have a much bigger impact on outcomes than</p><hr><div class="alert alert-info text-white bg-primary text-center">Follow <a href=https://twitter.com/solanaguide target=_blank style=color:#0f0 rel=nofollow>@solanaguide</a> on twitter for the latest updates!</div><div class=my-n3></div></main></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container-xxl><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 order-last order-lg-first"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item></li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-8 order-first order-lg-last text-lg-end"><ul class=list-inline></ul></div></div></div></footer><script src=https://solanaguide.github.io/js/bootstrap.min.586171fec3966d1a44fa8aa2edb24b861dc3a72be8cc24aa4e0dabe4c312a0dae5fe1eaa7c93180a6211fa4d7c5461b0d228fdf741be2eae279a376dfa1e7d81.js integrity="sha512-WGFx/sOWbRpE+oqi7bJLhh3DpyvozCSqTg2r5MMSoNrl/h6qfJMYCmIR+k18VGGw0ij990G+Lq4nmjdt+h59gQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script>
