How much do validators make? With over a thousand Solana validators operating at present there is a huge range in earnings, with many of the validators running at a loss, while some of the largest could be making profits in the millions each year.</description></item><item><title>Solana Coin Mining Guide: Profitability, Rewards &amp; Hardware</title><link>https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/solana-coin-mining-guide-profitability-rewards-hardware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/solana-coin-mining-guide-profitability-rewards-hardware/</guid><description>Can you mine Solana coins? No, as a proof of stake coin Solana cannot be mined, no matter how powerful your hardware or deep your pockets.
However Solana does offer two key ways you can help out the network in exchange for rewards:
Staking , where you can stake Solana you already own with a validator to earn rewards. Much as a bank pays interest on your deposits - in exchange for using your savings to fund mortgages and other investments - a Validator in the Solana network will pay your rewards of roughly 8% for allowing your coins to be staked to help confirm transactions on the network.</description></item><item><title>Staking On Solana: How To Stake Your Sol + Earn APY Rewards</title><link>https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/staking-on-solana-how-to-stake-your-sol-earn-apy-rewards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/staking-on-solana-how-to-stake-your-sol-earn-apy-rewards/</guid><description>What is Solana staking? Solana staking is where an owner of Solana coins (SOL) can &amp;lsquo;delegate&amp;rsquo; them to a validator in order to earn rewards, in much the same way you can &amp;lsquo;delegate&amp;rsquo; your home fiat currency to a bank in order to earn interest.
As Solana is a Proof Of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency it relies on users delegating stake to its validation network in order to keep the network healthy: the stake each validator holds is used to vote on transactions and confirm they are legitimate.</description></item></channel></rss>
