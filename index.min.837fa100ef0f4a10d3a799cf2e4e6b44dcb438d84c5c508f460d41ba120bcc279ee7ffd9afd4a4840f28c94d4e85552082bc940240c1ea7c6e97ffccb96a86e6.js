Many computers (nodes) verify transactions in a decentralized blockchain system like Solana and Ethereum. A malicious actor may want to add a large number of nodes to gain control of the network.

An alternative approach is to have the network validator nodes stake something like the SOL tokens in Solana’s instance. Although these validators also require power to work, it is much less than Bitcoin or Ethereum miners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolana has gained popularity among small-time and institutional traders because of its unique \u003cstrong\u003ehybrid consensus model.\u003c/strong\u003e The Solana Foundation aims to DeFi accessible to users on a larger scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="what-is-a-solana-cluster"\u003eWhat is a Solana Cluster?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general terms, a cluster refers to a group of computers working together simultaneously such that they appear to be a single system from the outside.

Every Solana cluster is a collection of individually owned computers that usually work together but compete against each other. These computers aid in the authentication of untrusted and user-submitted software output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cluster is also applicable when a user wishes to save an irreversible record of events or programmatic interpretations. It is possible to have several clusters coexisting; however, when two Solana clusters reside on the same genesis block, they attempt to merge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the technology\u0026rsquo;s applications include tracking which computers completed the critical tasks that contributed to the cluster\u0026rsquo;s continued operation. Another possibility is to keep track of real-world assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen separate Solana Clusters fail to converge, one can ignore the existence of the other.

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the way people want to eat at a busy restaurant rather than a deserted one (\u003cem\u003ewho knows what their kitchen looks like?!)\u003c/em\u003e or simply seeking security for their hard earned coins, choosing the well travelled path is a natural, human reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling is compounded by the fact that most lists of validators \u003cem\u003esort by stake\u003c/em\u003e, so the biggest in terms of scale almost always appear at the top of validator lists - including in some of the most popular Solana wallets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while natural, these feelings are deceptive for two reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour coins are safe, wherever they are staked:\u003c/strong\u003e\nSolana\u0026rsquo;s staking  system has been designed with safety in mind. Your staked funds are protected at all times, regardless of which validator you pick to generate your rewards. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if a validator has 10 million coins in delegated stake or just 100 - your assets are equally safe with either\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolana\u0026rsquo;s network relies on decentralization for Proof Of Stake to work\u003c/strong\u003e\nThe way Solana processes and approves transactions relies on stakes being spread across a wide range of validators. The more diverse and decentralized stakes are, the better for the health of the network overall.\nThere is a risk inherent in everyone choosing the most popular validator to stake their coins with: if the majority of coins end up staked with a small number of validators it can lead to a network halt, where inbuilt protections on the integrity of transactions stop working.\nInstead, for the sake of the network, it makes sense to spread stakes out across a far greater number of validators to prevent the likelyhood of a halt or intentional attack.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to invest in Solana staking it is in your best interests to support the network by avoiding further concentration of stake among the biggest validators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo our recommendation is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t choose the biggest operators for the sake of their size alone.\u003c/strong\u003e If anything, you should actively avoid them, and either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupport some of the smaller operators to grow their stake and further decentralize the network\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOr spread your stake out across multiple small operators to decentralize even more\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="2-the-amount-of-commission-the-validator-charges-in-fees"\u003e2. The amount of commission the validator charges in fees\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery validator earns rewards from Solana based on the size of stake they hold. These rewards are then passed to the stake owners, minus a fee that is set by the validator itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFees typically range from 0% (typically for \u0026lsquo;startup\u0026rsquo; validators aiming to attract new stakes) to 10+% for larger validators, or those with big brand names (we\u0026rsquo;re looking at you, exchanges and certain wallets!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking out the commission is straightforward: every validator\u0026rsquo;s commission is exposed publically, and it is simply deducted as a proportion of your rewards (not your stake!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor example:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stake 100 sol at a validator with 10% commission for one year. The APY for Solana during this period is 8%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYour 100 SOL generates 8 SOL in rewards\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e0.8 SOL (10% of those 8 SOL )is kept as a fee by the validator\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou receive a total of 7.2 SOL over the course of the year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the end of the year you own 107.2 SOL\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally it\u0026rsquo;s clear to see that the lower a commission, the greater your personal rewards. But commission is important to ensure a validator can afford to keep validating, giving them an incentive to keep their clusters performing well and generating rewards for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as we\u0026rsquo;ll see next, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not always the biggest impact on your overall return:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick tip:\u003c/strong\u003e When choosing a validator ensure you know which metrics you are looking at.\nFor example. in Phantom Wallet (one of Solana\u0026rsquo;s most popular) not only are validators listed by the biggest stake first (boo!) but they also show the commission rate next to each validator.. unlabelled.\nTo many first timers this can look like the APY reward you will see, not the actual commission paid! In reality the \u003cem\u003elower\u003c/em\u003e the number is in Phantom Wallet, the better for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="3-the-overall-performance-of-the-validator-pool"\u003e3.

So your APY can be affected far more dramatically by slow or broken validators than by their commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, rewards are also based on \u003cem\u003ethe amount of work done by a validator\u003c/em\u003e. This is not quite proof of work in the sense of Bitcoin, GPU farms and environmental destruction. But the fact is a validator earns rewards for every vote it participates in. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up - or is late - then no rewards are paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolana has been built for speed, and so if the hardware a validator is using is too slow to keep up, it will simply be ignored or \u0026lsquo;skipped\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can be seen by the \u0026lsquo;Skipped Vote %\u0026rsquo; shown on \u003ca href="http://validators.app"\u003eValidators.app\u003c/a\u003e . The less votes skipped, the higher the rewards earned each epoch. The higher the rewards, the greater your own share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting all these factors together can be complex, which is why a kind soul created \u003ca href="http://stakeview.app"\u003estakeview.app\u003c/a\u003e , which ranks validators not by overall size, but by expected APY, taking into account validator speed as well as commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExploring this site today* brings up some interesting numbers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTop is their own validator, with a large stake, high performance and 0% commission\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext are some tiny validators with awesome tech.

This means if you stake 100 SOL today, by this time next year you should be the proud owner of 108 SOL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. We are in a transformative period with cryptocurrency, and Solana is rapidly gaining credibility due to its incredibly fast transactions with very low fees. As a proof of stake network it comes without the baggage of traditional proof of work currencies such as Bitcoin and (for now) Ethereum, and is thriving with the current trend of NFTs as collectors see the huge difference in transaction feed between buying with SOL vs ETH\u0026rsquo;s outrageous gas fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this is to say there is a strong chance that Solana becomes more popular over time. Past performance is never an indicator of future results, but Solana has increased in price 65x since the start of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no guarantee that it will continue to rise at such a rate, but such increases are not unheard of in the crypto market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are bullish on crypto, and bullish on SOL\u0026rsquo;s proposition, then you could imagine a much greater increase in value over a year than 8%, when compared to a fiat currency such as USD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="how-long-until-i-earn-rewards-from-my-stake"\u003eHow long until I earn rewards from my stake?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="how-frequent-are-payouts"\u003eHow frequent are payouts?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear in mind that your rewards won\u0026rsquo;t start immediately. Solana\u0026rsquo;s validation network operates in a system of \u0026lsquo;epochs\u0026rsquo; - periods of typically 2-3 days - and rewards are earnt at the end of each epoch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you stake solana to a validator you must wait until the start of the next epoch to being earning rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I write we are near the end of epoch 220, with a few hours left until epoch 221 starts. If I was to stake 100 SOL now I would start earning rewards in a few hours time.\nHowever if I waited until the evening I would have missed the start of epopch 221, and my delegated stake would earn no rewards until epoch 221 ends and 222 begins, which would take roughly 2-3 days\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering too that \u003cstrong\u003eannual rewards\u003c/strong\u003e are around 8%. This means rewards per epoch are somewhat lower. Given there are around 134 epochs in a year, the reward you pay per epoch is roughly 0.06%, so you will need to give your investment time to accumulate significant rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with all kinds of investing it pays to \u0026lsquo;invest early, invest often\u0026rsquo; to appreciate the benefits of compounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="is-solana-staking-safe-what-are-the-risks-if-any"\u003eIs solana staking safe? What are the risks, if any?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, staking solana is extremely safe: at no point do the validators you stake with have any control over the coins you stake, and you remain in control of your coins throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any time you can request a withdrawal back to your main wallet - although you will need to wait until the end of the epoch before your coins will arrive, which can take anything from a couple of hours to a couple of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one risk that does exist is that the commission a validator charges on your rewards is subject to change depending on the whims of the owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that you may have signed up to a validator at a fee you thought was fair - say 8% - but the validator could increase this without warning. This might be a minor rise to something like 10%, which would slighly dent your income, or if they truly went rogue they might increase it to 100% and keep all the rewards for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever this would not affect the coins you have staked, just the rewards. Since your coins are simply \u0026lsquo;delegated\u0026rsquo;  to the validator and not under the validator\u0026rsquo;s control, should this happen your stake would still be 100% safe - you\u0026rsquo;d just stop earning rewards. You could simply leave and move your stake to another more reputable validator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis helps keep the market in check - validators rely on having a significant stake delegated to them in order to stay profitable, and any abusive practices would quickly lose their stake. It would be a classic case of killing the golden goose - a short term profit in exchange for a long term business failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally of course we should point out that the price of any cryptocurrency, including Solana, can go down as well as up.

It\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for large financial institutions to run their own private validators, setting the commission to a maximum of 100% to avoid 3rd parties delgating stake to the network. This is mostly done for regulatory reasons - they may have to account for the rewards paid to stakers which for a large financial institution could be a significant legal and administrative burden, so it is simpler to discourage others from staking with them and avoid the issue entirely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="is-solana-staking-worth-it"\u003eIs Solana staking worth it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="i-already-own-solana-should-i-be-staking-it"\u003eI already own Solana, should I be staking it?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor anyone holding Solana in a wallet\u003c/strong\u003e and with no plans to spend it in the next couple of days we would say staking is 100% worth it!

If you earn 15% on a coin that drops in value by 30% you\u0026rsquo;ve made a net loss, so you should really stake your funds with a coin you believe in and trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="why-does-solana-pay-rewards-to-crypto-stakers-what-are-the-benefits-for-them"\u003eWhy does Solana pay rewards to crypto stakers? What are the benefits for them?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolana\u0026rsquo;s goal is to offer a decentralized currency that is scalable, cost efficient and extremely fast. To do so it has based its coin on a Proof Of Stake system where validators help ensure the integrity of the system, approving transactions in a fraction of the time of other coins such as ETH or BTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to do so it needs to incentivise the validators to help assist in auditing transactions. Since each validator also needs to hold a stake as a sign it can be trusted, these rewards are shared with people who choose to stake their SOL in the validation network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy spreading stakes across the thousand+ validators in the network rather than concentrating it in the hands of a small minority it keeps the network robust and secure, preventing attacks from bad actors that might attempt to defraud holders of SOL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short: not only do you earn monetary rewards by staking your coins on Solana, but you actively help Solana reach its goals and ensure the integrity of the network. For many this is reason enough to stake coins or run validators, beyond any personal gain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="what-apy-can-you-earn-staking-solana"\u003eWhat APY can you earn staking solana?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe APY for Solana can fluctuate depending on the number of transactions per day and the speed at which validators complete an epoch, but at present it is between 7-8%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual amount of reward you receive each epoch can also vary based on the commission rate set by the validator you stake with. These are displayed transparently by the network, and typically range between 0 and 10%. It is worth noting that the operators of validators can change this rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour real world returns can also depend on the performance of a validator - how fast are they processing and voting on transactions?

Crucially some of the validators with low APY actually have fairly low commissions - between 5-10% - so their poor performance is due to technical issues rather than commission rate alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="is-there-a-minimum-amount-you-can-stake-on-solana"\u003eIs there a minimum amount you can stake on Solana?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no minimum amount you can stake on Solana. Each Solana coin (SOL) can be spent in tiny increments known as Lamports. Much like there are 100 cents in 1 Dollar, there are 10 billion (10,000,000,00) lamports in 1 SOL. Or put another way, 1 lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically you could stake just a handful of lamports, although not only would you be waiting forever for rewards of any useful size, but you would also likely spend more on transaction fees than you would ever stand to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with any sort of investment with a percentage return, the more you stake the greater your return.
